Open Actions Explorer
=====================

Visit the explorer live at: [Open Actions Explorer](http://tempdebug.appspot.com), developed during
the Open Data Hackathon on March 2, 2014.

Team Dashy powered by [Jon Clement](http://jonclement.com).


Features and Motivation
-----------------------

*	**Focusing on the System View**

        Similar to collecting a census, we begin our collaboration by acknowledging
        all participants and sources.	

*	**Giving you power over your own Interest Graph**

        The slide sorter allows you to pull interesting data sources into your Interest Graph.
        This can be used in the future for customizing news feeds.

*	**Concept Universe**

        Entities such as people, teams, datasets and resources have been extracted and displayed
        on the main landing page.

*	**Centralized Discussion**

        The exploration allows you to check-in to give feedback, suggestions or comments to any
        aspect of the system.  Rather then going to each participant, the communication system
        is centralized.

Deployment
----------

The application was deployed at 5pm on March the 2nd.  It is hosted on the Google AppEngine.
