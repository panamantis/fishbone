# BACKGROUND THREAD
# Code running on a backend can start a background thread, a thread that can "outlive" the request that spawns it. They allow backend instances to perform arbitrary periodic or scheduled tasks or to continue working in the background after a request has returned to the user.


# Class of machine:
#B1	128MB	600MHz	$0.08
#B2 (default)	256MB	1.2GHz	$0.16
#B4	512MB	2.4GHz	$0.32
#B8	1024MB	4.8GHz	$0.64

# Options:
#dynamic Defaults to resident instances. This option sets the backend to use dynamic instances rather than resident instances.
#failfast-Experimental! The failfast option disables pending queues, so that an instance that is busy returns an HTTP 503 error immediately when it receives a new request. You can achieve this same behavior by adding an X-AppEngine-FailFast header to requests, and the header is not experimental.
#public-Experimental! Sets backend access to public. Public backends can serve external HTTP requests from the web. See Public and Private Backends for more information.
